The Crypt Hunt is a collaborative inter-house event, in which you and the rest of your house work together to solve a series of cryptic riddles.
<!-- The event is divided into two phases: online and offline. -->
Questions will give you clues that send you on virtual scavenger hunts all over the internet.
<!-- - In the offline phase, you'll start with a question on the site, which will lead you to clues and unexpected challenges all over the school grounds. -->
